# DETECTION LAB

## Objective

To design and implement a controlled, isolated environment that simulates real-world enterprise systems for the purpose of developing, testing, and validating threat detection capabilities. The lab will support the collection and analysis of system and network telemetry, enable the safe execution of adversary techniques, and provide a foundation for continuous improvement in threat hunting, incident response, and detection engineering.


### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
